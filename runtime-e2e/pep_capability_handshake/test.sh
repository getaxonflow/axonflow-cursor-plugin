# Runtime proof for the ADR-065 PEP capability handshake
# (getaxonflow/axonflow-enterprise#3763).
#
# Two stages, and both drive the plugin's ACTUAL shipped shell - no
# reimplementation of the document, no reimplementation of the encoder.
#
#   Stage 1 (always) - the behaviour matrix plus its MUTATION GATE. The shipped
#   builder must produce the platform's own bytes for a valid audience and
#   NOTHING for every malformed one. The gate then plants each defect in a COPY
#   of the shipped script and requires the matrix to go red, so a green stage 1
#   is evidence rather than decoration.
#
#   Stage 2 (when a real AxonFlow agent is reachable) - the honest end of the
#   claim. Sends the declaration the shipped script built to a REAL agent on a
#   real governed route and requires the agent to ACCEPT it, then sends a
#   deliberately malformed one and requires a 400 that NAMES the header. Nothing
#   in this stage knows what the platform's grammar is; the agent decides.
#
# Stage 2 is skipped when no agent is reachable, which is the norm on CI
# runners. It is never the only evidence: stage 1 covers the encoding
# deterministically.
#
# Run:
#   ./runtime-e2e/pep_capability_handshake/test.sh
#   AXONFLOW_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080 ./runtime-e2e/pep_capability_handshake/test.sh
