# runtime-e2e/tier-expiry — V1 SaaS Plugin Pro tier-line expiry surface

## What it asserts

The user-facing `scripts/status.sh` (the same script the
`/axonflow-status` skill guides the agent to run from the integrated
terminal) renders one of three tier-line shapes depending on the
configured Pro license token's JWT `exp` claim:

| State          | Shape                                                                             |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Free           | `tier   Free (no Pro license configured)`                                         |
| Pro active     | `tier   Pro (expires YYYY-MM-DD, N days remaining)`                               |
| Pro expired    | `tier   Free (Pro expired YYYY-MM-DD — visit https://getaxonflow.com/pricing/ to renew)` |

Plus security guarantees:
- Full bearer token is NEVER printed; only the last 4 chars in the
  `AXON-...XXXX` redaction.
- Pro-expired output surfaces the renewal hint
  (`After buying a renewal, replace the token: ...`).

## How to run

```bash
bash runtime-e2e/tier-expiry/test.sh
```

No env vars required. Mints three structurally-valid AXON- JWT tokens
on the fly with explicit `exp` claims and runs the actual
`scripts/status.sh` against them in an isolated `$HOME` so the
developer's real `~/.config/axonflow` is never touched.

## Why this is real-surface runtime proof (HARD RULE #0)

- The script under test IS the script users invoke via the integrated
  terminal — same file, same path, same env-var resolution order.
- The license tokens are real AXON-prefixed JWTs (header.payload.sig
  base64url-encoded). The JWT-parsing branch in `status.sh` does NOT
  distinguish a platform-minted token from a test-minted one
  structurally — both decode the same way and exit the same code path.
- No network mock, no fake stdout capture, no shimmed command. We
  invoke the actual `scripts/status.sh` against an isolated `$HOME`
  and assert the actual stdout grep-shape.

## Coverage scope

- Free path (no token)              — Test 1
- Pro active (exp in future)        — Test 2 + token-leak guard + last-4 redaction
- Pro expired (exp in past)         — Test 3 + token-leak guard + renewal hint
- Wire-up (X-License-Token sent)    — `runtime-e2e/mcp-session-headers/` (separate concern)
