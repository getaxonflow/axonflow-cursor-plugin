# user-token — runtime E2E

**Asserts** (axonflow-enterprise#2943, Cursor port of claude-plugin#107,
epic #2919), by driving the plugin's real hook scripts
(`pre-tool-check.sh` → `check_policy`, `post-tool-audit.sh` →
`audit_tool_call`) against a live AxonFlow agent and reading the canonical
`audit_logs` rows back from the platform DB — no mocks, no stubs:

1. **Unconfigured (the common fleet state):** with no per-user token anywhere,
   governed rows are written and attribute exactly as before (the
   client-scoped fallback identity) — the plugin's behavior is byte-identical
   to pre-1.6.
2. **Validated identity (platform with enterprise#2929+):** with a REAL minted
   per-user token configured (env for the pre-tool plane, 0600
   `user-token.json` for the post-tool plane), governed rows on BOTH planes
   attribute to the **token's canonical email** instead of the client-scoped
   fallback. NOTE (Cursor vs Claude Code): the Cursor hooks send no
   `X-User-Email` label at all, so there is no forgeable-label surface to
   beat here — the assertion is that the validated identity replaces the
   client-scoped fallback attribution on every row, and that zero rows for
   these calls attribute to anything else.
3. **Unhappy path (fail-closed):** a tampered token → the platform rejects
   the request (HTTP 401, JSON-RPC `-32001`) and `pre-tool-check.sh` blocks
   with **exit 2** and a stderr reason naming the per-user token as the
   likely cause. Tool calls do NOT silently fall open on a bad credential,
   and the token value never appears in any output.

Row identification: Cursor's hooks send no `X-Session-Id`, so rows are keyed
on unique per-run tool names (`audit_logs.query` = `mcp check_policy:
cursor.<tool>` on the pre plane, `Tool: <tool>` on the post plane).

Legs 2–3 need a platform that validates `X-User-Token`
(`authenticateMCPServerRequest` → `extractPerUserToken`, enterprise#2929). The
harness probes for that capability by presenting a garbage token: a pre-#2929
platform ignores the header (probe succeeds → legs 2–3 SKIP with a notice), a
post-#2929 enterprise platform rejects it.

**Prereqs:** `jq`, `curl`, `psql`, `python3` on PATH; a live agent at
`$AXONFLOW_ENDPOINT` (default `http://localhost:8080`); an enterprise Basic
credential (`AXONFLOW_AUTH`, or `AXONFLOW_E2E_ENTERPRISE_AUTH`, or
`AXONFLOW_E2E_ORG_ID` + `AXONFLOW_E2E_LICENSE_KEY`); `AXONFLOW_E2E_DB_URL`
pointing at the platform DB. For the token legs, ONE of:

- `AXONFLOW_E2E_USER_TOKEN` + `AXONFLOW_E2E_USER_TOKEN_EMAIL` — a real token
  minted via the platform admin API
  (`POST /api/v1/admin/organizations/{org_id}/user-tokens`, enterprise#2930)
  and the email it was minted for; or
- `AXONFLOW_E2E_JWT_SECRET` — the agent's `JWT_SECRET`; the harness signs an
  HS256 token with the exact claims contract the mint API produces
  (`iss=axonflow-user-token-mint`, `email`, `role`, `org_id`, `jti`, `iat`,
  `exp`). The platform validates it for real — same signature check, same
  org binding, same revocation lookup — so this is the mint contract, not a
  mock. Requires `AXONFLOW_E2E_ORG_ID` (the org the Basic credential
  authenticates as).

Skips cleanly when any prereq is absent.

**Run (local stack):**
```bash
AXONFLOW_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080 \
AXONFLOW_E2E_ORG_ID=<org> AXONFLOW_E2E_LICENSE_KEY=AXON-... \
AXONFLOW_E2E_JWT_SECRET=<agent JWT_SECRET> \
AXONFLOW_E2E_DB_URL='postgres://axonflow:localdev123@localhost:5432/axonflow?sslmode=disable' \
  bash runtime-e2e/user-token/test.sh
```
