# Telemetry heartbeat — fires at most once every 7 days per machine.
#
# Sends a POST to checkpoint.getaxonflow.com/v1/ping with plugin version,
# platform info (OS, arch, bash version), the AxonFlow platform version, and
# the licence tier that platform reports about itself (a coarse bucket such as
# Community or Enterprise — no licence key, no expiry, no seat count, no
# customer name). No PII, no tool arguments, no policy data.
#
# Cadence design rules (per feedback_telemetry_heartbeat_design_rules.md):
#   1. Stamp-on-delivery, not stamp-on-attempt. The stamp file mtime is
#      advanced ONLY after curl returns 2xx. Transient network failures do
#      not silence telemetry for 7 days; the next active call retries.
#   2. In-flight gate via flock. When N concurrent hooks fire at once,
#      exactly one ping goes out — others fast-path past the lock.
#   3. Opt-out check FIRST, before any rate-limit cache or filesystem ops.
#      AXONFLOW_TELEMETRY=off toggled mid-process is honoured immediately.
#   4. mtime as the freshness source. The stamp file body holds the per-
#      machine instance_id (debug only); freshness comes from the timestamp.
#   5. Cross-platform stat: BSD (macOS) uses -f %m, GNU uses -c %Y. The
#      bash plugins ship on macOS/Linux only so the $HOME/.cache path is
#      portable enough.
#
# Opt out: AXONFLOW_TELEMETRY=off
#
# Note: DO_NOT_TRACK is intentionally not honored. Host CLIs commonly inject
# DO_NOT_TRACK=1 into every hook subprocess regardless of user intent.
#
# This script NEVER exits non-zero — errors are silently swallowed and
# never block hook execution (called with & from pre-tool-check.sh).

# Dependencies — exit silently if missing

# THREE DIMENSIONS THAT SOUND ALIKE AND ARE NOT. Do not collapse any pair of
# them; each answers a different question and they disagree routinely:
#
#   license_tier    WHAT LICENCE THE PLATFORM SAYS IT IS RUNNING UNDER.
#                   Server-asserted — the plugin relays it and never derives,
#                   guesses, or corrects it. A self-hosted install pointed at
#                   by this plugin can be on any tier.
#   deployment_mode WHERE THIS PLUGIN IS POINTED, classified locally from the
#                   endpoint host (community_saas | self_hosted | unknown).
#                   Carries no licence information whatsoever: a self_hosted
#                   endpoint is routinely Enterprise, and community_saas is a
#                   hosting topology, not the "Community" tier.
#   endpoint_type   NETWORK REACHABILITY of that endpoint (localhost |
#                   private_network | remote). Carries neither of the above.
#
# The value is relayed VERBATIM and never normalized here. The receiver owns
# the canonical mapping, so a tier this build has never heard of still buckets
# correctly server-side instead of being flattened into "unknown" by a client
# that shipped before the tier existed. Values seen in practice today include
# the canonical set (Community / Evaluation / Professional / Enterprise /
# Plus), the lowercase "community" that community-mode builds default to, and
# "starting" — the transient pre-initialisation answer, which is a real and
# deliberately-reported state, not an error.
#
# OMITTED, never sent as "unknown", whenever the probe could not establish it:
# unreachable endpoint, non-2xx, malformed or non-object body, and a `tier`
# that is absent, blank, or not a string. Omission is the wire's existing
# "this client did not report" signal (the field is `omitempty` server-side);
# sending a literal "unknown" would instead assert that the platform answered
# and said it did not know, which is a different and false claim.
# The `type == "object"` half is defence in depth and deliberately NOT
# load-bearing: jq already errors when asked for `.tier` of an array, string or
# number, the error is swallowed, and the result is the same empty value. It is
# here so the non-object case reads as intended rather than accidental. The
# STRING check is the half that earns its keep. The mutation gate plants the
# object check's removal as a must-SURVIVE control, so if it ever becomes
# observable the gate says so instead of this comment quietly going stale.
