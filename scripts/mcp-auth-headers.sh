#   1. AXONFLOW_AUTH already exported by the user → use it (self-hosted /
#      enterprise / explicit credential).
#   2. No explicit AXONFLOW_AUTH and no AXONFLOW_ENDPOINT → run the
#      Community-SaaS bootstrap to register against try.getaxonflow.com
#      and load the resulting Basic-auth credential.
#   3. AXONFLOW_AUTH still empty after that (bootstrap couldn't run /
#      degraded) → emit empty headers (Community-mode self-hosted, no auth).

# When this script is invoked by Cursor's MCP headersHelper, AXONFLOW_MODE
# is not yet set; resolve it the same way pre-tool-check.sh does so the
# bootstrap helper makes the right call.
