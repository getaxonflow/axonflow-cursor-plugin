# PreToolUse hook — evaluate tool inputs against AxonFlow governance policies.
# Adapted for Cursor IDE from the Claude Code plugin.
#
# Reads tool_name and tool_input from stdin (JSON), or a beforeShellExecution
# payload ({command, cwd}).
# Calls AxonFlow check_policy via the MCP server endpoint.
#
# Cursor hook exit codes (https://cursor.com/docs/hooks, read 2026-09-16):
#   Exit 0 = allow (no opinion)
#   Exit 2 = block (tool execution prevented; equivalent to permission "deny")
#   Other non-zero = non-blocking error (tool proceeds)
#
# Every block but one goes through axonflow_pre_deny: exit 2, the reason on stderr, and
# the documented deny JSON on stdout ({"permission":"deny","user_message",
# "agent_message"}). Exit 2 is the block on its own; the JSON carries the
# user_message wherever Cursor reads stdout on exit 2 (unverified without an
# IDE capture). The exception is the shell-write redaction (PII_ACTION=redact):
# it prints the deny JSON on exit 0, because its agent_message must carry the
# redacted content for the retry.
