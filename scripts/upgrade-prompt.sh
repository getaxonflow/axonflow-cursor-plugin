# V1 Plugin Pro upgrade-prompt envelope handling (umbrella getaxonflow/axonflow-enterprise#1958).
#
# Sourceable helpers used by the plugin's hook scripts to:
#   1. Detect the V1 Plugin Pro structured envelope on 429 / 403 responses
#      from the AxonFlow agent.
#   2. Surface the envelope's upgrade.wording to the operator on stderr,
#      with a once-per-day stamp so the message doesn't spam every hook.
#   3. Honor the Retry-After header by stamping a throttle-until file —
#      subsequent invocations short-circuit the network call locally
#      until the deadline passes (matches the deadline carried in the
#      envelope's resets_at). Prevents the silent-retry pattern that
#      generated 581 retries from one IP in 18h pre-envelope.
#
# All output goes to stderr; stdout is reserved for the Claude Code hook
# protocol (any byte on stdout from a non-deny path breaks the parser).
#
# Cache layout (mode 0700):
#   ~/.cache/axonflow/throttle-until                       — epoch deadline file
#   ~/.cache/axonflow/upgrade-prompt-last-shown            — tier-limit nudge stamp (YYYY-MM-DD)
#   ~/.cache/axonflow/auth-failure-prompt-last-shown       — HTTP 401 nudge stamp (YYYY-MM-DD)
#
# Functions exported to callers:
#   axonflow_throttle_active            — exit 0 if throttle deadline still in future
#   axonflow_handle_envelope_response   — args: <http_code> <body_file> <headers_file>
#   axonflow_handle_auth_failure        — args: <http_code> <body_file> <headers_file>
#                                         stamps a 5-minute throttle on HTTP 401 so
#                                         a broken AXONFLOW_AUTH credential does not
#                                         storm the agent on every hook fire (see
#                                         getaxonflow/axonflow-enterprise#2275).

# The stamp rules (axonflow-enterprise#4249, comment 5684124176). The
# throttle-until file is ONE line, `<epoch> <limit_type>`, and it is shared:
# the Claude Code and Codex hooks (and, on Linux, the OpenClaw plugin) read and
# write the same file. Its write and its format are unchanged here; what
# changed is which stamps gate a governed call in these hooks:
#   1. of the limit stamps, only a request-rate limit (daily_quota,
#      per_minute) gates;
#   2. a feature or object-count limit (feature_pro_only, active_policies,
#      hitl_approvals_window, decision_list_size) shows its upgrade prompt
#      when it is answered and gates nothing;
#   3. a request-rate stamp is honoured for at most
#      _AXONFLOW_LIMIT_STAMP_MAX_HONOUR_SECONDS after its file was written,
#      then the hook asks the platform again (a local deny never sees a reset
#      or an upgrade; a hitl_approvals_window resets_at is a week out);
#   4. a stamp whose file was written more than
#      _AXONFLOW_STAMP_CLOCK_SKEW_SECONDS in the future counts as past the cap;
#   5. a stamp of another type, or past the cap, is left on disk: another
#      plugin that wrote it may still honour it;
#   6. the auth_failure cooldown a 401 stamps gates for its configured length
#      (_AXONFLOW_AUTH_FAILURE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS), counted from when its file was
#      written (rule 4's skew applies), not the 300-second limit cap and not the
