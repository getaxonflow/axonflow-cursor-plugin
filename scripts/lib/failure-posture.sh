# The failure posture both hooks read (scripts/pre-tool-check.sh and
# scripts/post-tool-audit.sh), kept in one place so the two cannot drift.
# Shared with the Codex and Claude Code plugins, except axonflow_fail_mode_open
# (the Cursor default is closed; see that function).
# Sourced, never executed. Each hook maps a class to its own action: the pre
# hook blocks or runs ungoverned, the post hook alerts or passes with a notice.
#
# HTTP 401 and the Free-tier envelope are settled before this table (the
# helpers in scripts/upgrade-prompt.sh). axonflow_status_class then reads the
# status of the answer that is left:
#
#   answer     2xx, or a non-2xx whose body is a JSON-RPC answer (a non-null
#              result, or an error object): read as the platform's answer
#   limit      429, whatever the body
#   refused    3xx (a redirect: the endpoint is misconfigured) and a 4xx other
#              than 408, 413 and 429, without a JSON-RPC answer
#   too_large  413 without a JSON-RPC answer (the request was bigger than the
#              agent or a proxy accepts): refused, with the size named
#   no_answer  408, 5xx and any other status without a JSON-RPC answer
#
# Within a JSON-RPC error, the code decides (axonflow_jsonrpc_error_code):
# -32603 (internal) and -32700 (parse) are no usable answer; every other code,
# and an error object without a numeric code, refused the call.

# axonflow_fail_mode_open
#   Returns 0 only when AXONFLOW_FAIL_MODE is "open" (any case): a check that
#   got no usable answer lets the call run. Unset, empty and any other value
#   block it.
#
#   THE CURSOR DEFAULT IS CLOSED, unlike the Claude Code and Codex copies of
#   this table (where unset runs with a notice). Cursor's hook contract has a
#   user-visible field only on a deny (preToolUse user_message, "shown to user
#   when denied", https://cursor.com/docs/hooks, read 2026-09-16), so a call
#   that ran ungoverned could not be shown to the person at all. Never silent
#   therefore means blocked by default here; "open" is the explicit opt-in to
#   running ungoverned, silently to the user by the host's design.
