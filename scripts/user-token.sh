# Per-user authorization token resolution for governed AxonFlow requests —
# axonflow-enterprise#2943 (epic #2919: per-user identity + role on the
# fleet/MCP-server plane; Cursor port of axonflow-claude-plugin#107).
#
# The platform's fleet plane authenticates the TENANT with the shared Basic
# credential; a per-user token yields a VALIDATED, non-forgeable
# {identity, role} for the developer behind the session
# (platform/agent/mcp_server_handler.go authenticateMCPServerRequest →
# extractPerUserToken, which reads the `X-User-Token` header). The token is
# minted by an org admin via the platform mint API
# (POST /api/v1/admin/organizations/{org_id}/user-tokens, enterprise#2930)
# and delivered to each developer via managed settings / MDM.
#
# This file is sourced by the hooks (pre-tool-check.sh, post-tool-audit.sh)
# and the headers reference impl (mcp-auth-headers.sh) — never invoked. After
# sourcing and calling resolve_user_token, AXONFLOW_USER_TOKEN is exported
# with the resolved token (unset/empty if none is configured). The callers
# send it as `X-User-Token` ONLY when non-empty — an unconfigured developer's
# requests are byte-identical to today's (no empty header), and the platform
# keeps its existing least-privilege attribution path.
#
# NOTE (Cursor-specific): the MCP server connection Cursor itself opens uses
# mcp.json's STATIC `headers` with plain env expansion — Cursor has no
# headersHelper (cursor#43), so that plane reads `${AXONFLOW_USER_TOKEN}`
# raw from the environment and CANNOT run this resolver (no 0600-file
# fallback, no local wire-safety strip-check on that plane). An unset env
# var expands to an EMPTY header value, which the platform treats as absent
# (strings.TrimSpace in extractPerUserToken) — safe for unconfigured users.
#
# Resolution order (canonical, must not change without a CHANGELOG entry):
#
#   1. AXONFLOW_USER_TOKEN env var (managed settings / MDM env block) —
#      wins outright.
#   2. ~/.config/axonflow/user-token.json — {"token": "<minted token>"},
#      written by the fleet's provisioning tooling.
#
# Mode is 0600 inside a 0700 directory — same permissions discipline as
# the license-token file. A file with non-0600 permissions is REJECTED with
# a stderr warning rather than loaded silently.
#
# The token VALUE is a credential: it is never logged, never echoed, and
# never written to stdout by this helper (stdout belongs to the calling
# hook's protocol).
#
# Never exits non-zero. Never blocks the calling hook.

# user_token_looks_valid — sanity-gate a candidate token before it goes on
# the wire. Minted per-user tokens (HS256 Path A and OIDC Path B) are compact
# JWTs: base64url segments joined by dots — no whitespace, no control bytes,
# no quotes, no backslashes. A candidate containing any of those is junk
# (mis-pasted, truncated multi-line, or corrupted), and sending it would be
# WORSE than sending nothing: the platform fails closed on a presented-but-
# invalid token (an access attempt, not a legacy caller), turning every
# governed call into an auth denial. Rejecting locally keeps the developer on
# the least-privilege path with a clear stderr diagnostic instead.
#
# Deliberately does NOT pin the JWT structure (segment count, prefix): the
# platform owns token-format evolution; this guard only rejects values that
# can never be a wire-safe credential. The check also guarantees the value is
# safe to interpolate into mcp-auth-headers.sh's hand-quoted no-jq JSON
# fallback (no quote/backslash escaping needed) and into an HTTP header (no
# CR/LF header-splitting bytes).
